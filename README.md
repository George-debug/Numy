# Numy
Numy is my final high school project, a puzzle game inspired by [Numberama](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kila.zahlenspielpro.lars). I wrote the first version of this project under the supervision of Grigoraş Marcel and Lombadă Ecaterina, and it went through numerous [redesigns](https://imgur.com/a/8Xdh5fK) and refactoring. Being the definition of a perfectionist, I will rewrite the code until I'm somewhat satisfied with the result.

## HOW TO PLAY
  Clear the playing field by crossing out the numbers. Two numbers can be removed if they are equal or sum up 10.
  The numbers should be in one column or side by side. Every level is solvable!

## Buttons
 * **Check**: get the first possible move
 * **Add**: add numbers to the playing field. After every 4 adds, this button will mix the numbers.
 * **Level**: type the level
 * **New**: start the new game within the current level
