# Numy
Numy is my final high school project, a puzzle game inspired by [Numberama](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kila.zahlenspielpro.lars). I wrote the first version of this project under the supervision of Grigoraş Marcel and Lombadă Ecaterina, and it went through numerous [redesigns](https://imgur.com/a/8Xdh5fK) and refactoring. Being the definition of a perfectionist, I will rewrite the code until I'm somewhat satisfied with the result.

## HOW TO PLAY
Clear the playing field by crossing out the numbers. You can remove two numbers if they are equal or sum up ten. The numbers need to be on the same column or the same row without any numbers between them.
The row continues starting at the first column of the following line, so the whole playboard is just a long line. Every level is solvable!

## Buttons
 * **Check**: Shows you a possible pair
 * **Add**: add numbers to the playing field. After every 4 adds, this button will mix the numbers.
 * **Level**: type the level
 * **New**: start the new game with the current level
