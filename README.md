# Numy
Numy is my final highschool project, a puzzle game inspired by [Numberama](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kila.zahlenspielpro.lars).
The first version of project was written under the supervision of Grigoraş Marcel and Lombadă Ecaterina and went through noumerous [**redesigns**](https://imgur.com/a/8Xdh5fK) and refactoring. Being the definition of a perfectionist, this project will be rewritten until I'm somewhat satisfied with the result.

## HOW TO PLAY
  Clear the playing field by crossing out the numbers. Two numbers can be removed if they are equal or sum up 10.
  The numbers should be in one column or side by side. Every level is solvable!
